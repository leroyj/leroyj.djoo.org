My needs I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a solution with no maintenance that helps me to focus on writing content and not maintaining the full system. So don&amp;rsquo;t expect a microservice architectured CMS on AWS Lambda though we might use it for some projects later :)
I also want a system with multilingual support to write in Globish 🇬🇧🇺🇸 and French 🇫🇷.
This fits completely the architecture pattern called Jamstack (Javascript, API, Markup stack) that sits on top of pre-rendering and decoupling.</description></item></channel></rss>
