My needs I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a solution with no maintenance that helps me to focus on writing content and not maintaining the full system. So don&amp;rsquo;t expect a microservice architectured CMS on AWS Lambda though we might use it for some projects later :)

This fits completely the architecture type called Jamstack that sits on top of pre-rendering and decoupling.</description></item></channel></rss>
